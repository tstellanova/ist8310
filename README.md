This sensor is claimed to be pin-compatible with the HMC5883 magnetometer. 

## Status

- [ ] Basic i2c setup support
- [ ] read of main xyz magentometer vector
- [ ] Tests with mock embedded hal
- [ ] Periodic configuration check (for poor i2c connections)
- [ ] Usage example with `cortex-m` hal
- [ ] CI
